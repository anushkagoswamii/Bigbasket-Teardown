# BigBasket Product Teardown

**Project Type:** Product Strategy & Analytics  
**Role:** Product Analyst (Case Study)  
**Timeline:** July 2025

## Objective

To identify key product issues in BigBasket's user experience and propose data-driven solutions aimed at increasing:

- Average Order Value (AOV)
- Conversion Rate (CR)
- Repeat Purchase Rate
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)

## Scope of Work

- Conducted market and product research on BigBasket’s operations, business model, and user metrics (AOV, CR, CLTV, GMV)
- Analyzed user journey to identify friction points affecting order value, frequency, and satisfaction
- Applied RICE prioritization to determine high-impact areas for improvement
- Designed and structured three product solutions focused on user needs and business outcomes

## Key Problems Identified

1. Hidden charges and coupon visibility during checkout
2. Lack of personalized discovery and reordering features
3. Unavailability of preferred delivery slots for regular users

## Prioritization Framework

Used the RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) model to evaluate and rank problems:

| Problem                                     | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score |
|--------------------------------------------|-------|--------|------------|--------|-------------|
| Hidden charges & coupon visibility         | High  | High   | Medium     | Low    | 2400        |
| Lack of personalization (health/reordering)| Medium| High   | High       | Medium | 1080        |
| Delivery slot unavailability               | Medium| Medium | Medium     | Medium | 450         |

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. ClearCart – Checkout Transparency Model
- Display delivery charges upfront on product and cart pages
- Show auto-applicable coupons and real-time savings in cart
- Improve pricing clarity to reduce cart drop-offs

### 2. SmartShop – Personalized Reordering Engine
- Introduce health-based filters (e.g., low sugar, organic)
- Add smart reorder blocks for frequent purchases
- Enable "frequently bought together" bundles to boost AOV

### 3. BB Saver – Weekly Subscription Model
- Users subscribe for weekly deliveries of essentials
- Get access to preferred slots and exclusive coupons
- Encourages repeat orders and predictable revenue

## Expected Impact

| Metric                 | Projected Uplift |
|------------------------|------------------|
| Average Order Value    | +15%             |
| Repeat Purchase Rate   | +18%             |
| Customer Lifetime Value| +20%             |
| Conversion Rate        | +10%             |
